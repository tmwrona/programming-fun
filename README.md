This repository is solely for the purpose of code challenges that I have completed for the heck of it. It is not all inclusive of everything I have done, but it's a start.

I do not take credit for these ideas, only the code to complete them. Most of these are taken from 100 Days of Code Python Programming Challenge on Udemy.com.
